# adios-wrappers

## NOTE

This is a new project, which only has a small set of modules at the moment. Users are expected to have some Adios knowledge coming in.

# Installation

### Flakes

See the flakes installation guide [here](./docs/installation-flakes.md).

### Non-flakes

See the non-flakes installation guide [here](./docs/installation-nonflakes.md).

# Usage

# Searching for options

You're always free to inspect the modules themselves. However, in lieu of a fancy website, the repo also provides an
auto-generated JSON file with information on which options each module provides. You can find the file
[here](./docs/options.json)
